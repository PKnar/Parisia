                <h4>Idea</h4>
                <p>For this assignment we chose to make a Responsive Travel website for Paris.<br>
                    Our goal for this website was to make it all in one in a way. To to do that<br>
                    we decided to have cards for each destination and each card would include <br>
                    buttons, that would allow the use to buy the ticket, book a taxi or check for <br>
                    available transportation methods. Which would be useful for any traveler.

            <div class='intro-content section'>
                <h4>Target User</h4>
                <p>
                    Even though this website could be used by any traveler.<br>
                    We wanted to create something more. Having group travelers <br>
                    in our mind we decided to build a group chat feature, in it,<br>
                    where the trip organizer could add people, choose destinations <br>
                    and post it on a feed etc.
                    <br>
                    Our initial target group would be school trip organizers.
                    Paris is a common destionation for school trips , so having<br>
                    everything in one place could be helpful for the trip leaders.

                Considering the fact that we all were new to the prototyping we knew this assignment <br>
                would take a time. That is why, after coming up with ideas and making some sketches <br>
                we decided to divide the tasks between 3 of us.<br>
                <strong>Cleo</strong>, was assigned to put the sketches and ideas together and turn them into<br>
                higher quality Sketches, plus the Storyboard.<br>
                <strong>Thomas</strong> was assigned to do the Wireframes & Personas.<br>
                <strong> I (Knarik) </strong>was assigned to do the digital prototype & the presentation website.
                <br>
                <br>
                All of us were actively involved in this assignment. There was no "I did more you did less", the tasks <br>
                were equally divided.Overall it was a nice experience to work with each other.<br>
                Even though each one of us did our part, we also were involved in each other's tasks through giving opinions/feedback.
                <br>
                <strong>Here is the timeline to our final product</strong>

                    <p><strong>In her own words:</strong>
                        "I used the screenshots and wireframes Thomas has made and the prototype files that Knarik made.
                        First I started with some research on storyboards of all kinds.
                        After this I chose a few I liked the most and just then as a reference for my own storyboard.
                        I also just use a vector character to make the sketches look more professional.
                        See the picture below for the vector.

                        Next time I will use more vectors and draw less myself.
                        This storyboard was really time consuming and a lot of work.
                        But I really enjoyed working on it. I think the storyboard gives a
                        good indication about the function of the app and all its features.

        <p>Created by Thomas</p>
        <p id='thomas-message'><strong>In his own words:</strong>
            "I decided to make two personas and create a little bit of variation by making one of them male and the
            other female. I made the female (Alex) a history teacher that needs an information and booking website for
            her next trip to Paris with her students. I made the male (Felix) a youtuber that needs an information and
            booking website for his next trip to Paris where he wants to vlog his experience.
            To make these personas I used a website called theydo.io which is used a lot by companies to make personas
            for their product. Itâ€™s a very easy to use tool and does a lot of the work for you.

            After the initial paper sketches, Cleo drew the final versions of them. She loves drawing , so this was the

            And they turned out really well.

        <h1>Wireframe</h1>
        <p>Thomas was assigned to turn these sketches into Wireframes</p>
        <p id="thomas-wireframe"><strong>In his own words:</strong>
            "
            My main job during this project was to make the Wireframe of the website. Although it at first seemed like a
            simple task, it turned out to be quite tricky. My group member, Cleo, made drawings of how the website would
            approximately look like and I had to make a digitalized detailed version of those drawings.

            First thing I did was too really analyze the drawings and brainstorm how I can make it look better. For the
            design I used a software called Pencil which was a very good choice. My mockup has a black and white design,
            and the grey boxes were to show where there would be pictures. I consulted this with my group members, and
            they were very happy with it.

            I also wanted to make sure that the mockup was not too detailed since it must be as simple as possible. This
            was very hard for me because I sometimes was not sure if it was too much or not.
            In my opinion this was a hard task especially for me because I am not a very artsy person. This forced me to
            come out of my comfort zone and do something I am not very good at. I learned a lot from doing the mockup
            and thankfully I had my team members supporting me all the way through.

            Next time I do a mockup, I will try to put in a little extra detail if possible and make it look a lot more
            appealing.

        <h1>Prototype</h1>
        <p>My (Knarik) task was to make the prototype on 'Adobe XD'.
            I wanted to explore this program for a very long time and I am glad I had the
            opporunity to work with it. This certainly was not an easy task,I often found myself focusing on details a
            lot.
            But other than that it was worth it. All 3 of us wanted to deliever a good project and I hope we managed to
            do it.
            I prototyped the desktop and the mobile version of the website. I tried to follow the Usability Heuristics
            and made the mobile version almost identical to the desktop version, so that the user would not have a hard
            time navigating around it.
            <strong>Below you can find the videos of the final flow of the prototype of our product.</strong>

        <h1>The Outcomes</h1>
        <p> Just like the first Interviewee mentioned our website was missing an extra information on what they can use
            it for.
            Below is the before after picture of the changes I have made. I added 3 white boxes at the home page, that
            contains what our website has to offer. Other than that it was nice to know that both interviewees would use
            the website, and that the chatting featured was welcomed well too.
